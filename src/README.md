# Simple genome simulation
These variations are included:
- [x] SNPs
- [ ] Insertions
- [ ] Deletions
- [ ] Translocations
- [ ] Inversions
- [ ] Distal duplications
- [ ] Tandem duplications
- [ ] Transpositions

Interesting ideas for later: 
- SNP profile next to SV
- Multiple genomes?
- Duplications removables (inverted of adding duplications)
