# Simple genome simulation
These variations are included:
- [x] SNPs
- [x] Insertions
- [x] Deletions
- [x] Translocations
- [x] Inversions
- [x] Distal duplications
- [x] Tandem duplications
- [x] Transpositions

Interesting ideas for later: 
- SNP profile next to SV
- Multiple genomes?
- Duplications removables (inverted of adding duplications)
